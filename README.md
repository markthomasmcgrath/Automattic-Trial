# Automattic-Trial
Sample GitHub for Automattic Trial Project

## Project Summary
Turn it Around (TIA) is expanding their mission of fostering anti-bullying cultures nationally and looking to increase their scope from working primarily with middle and high schools to also working with community centres, daycares and college campuses.

They need a redesigned website which reflects this growth plan and integrates their recently finalized brand guidelines.

Additionally, they would like their redesigned website to contain a directory of virtual resources for students and counselors to easily access the support theyâ€™re seeking related to anti-bullying initiatives. 

To further enhance access to the resources, a chatbot has been discussed to streamline resource access even more. 

## Deliverables
There are three primary deliverables for this project:

1. An initial survey to solicit feedback and encourage buy-in from internal stakeholders
2. Recommendations for a chatbot to be integrated into the completed website 
3. A website redesign of www.turnitaround.org

## Timeline
Phase 1 of the website redesign is to launch by October 25, 2020.
